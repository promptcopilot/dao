# Prompt Copilot: AI-Core Modules DAO

Welcome to the Prompt Copilot: AI-Core Modules DAO. This is a fully decentralized and unstoppable platform governed by its community. Our focus is on developing, managing, and applying AI core modules in an open and democratic ecosystem.

## Purpose
Our mission is to create a truly decentralized platform that encourages collaborative development, transparent governance, and unrestricted access to AI core modules. We aim to cultivate a platform that is autonomous, upgradeable, and governed by its community.

## Objectives
1. **Collaborative Development:** Encourage developers to contribute towards enhancing and expanding the AI module library, thereby increasing the diversity and capacity of AI functionalities.
2. **Decentralized Governance:** Empower participants with voting rights on key decisions, fostering a democratic and transparent ecosystem where everyone has an equal say.
3. **Open Access:** Provide unrestricted access to AI modules, empowering users to create AI-based applications, businesses, and services.
4. **Scalability:** Facilitate the expansion of the ecosystem to include an increasingly diverse range of AI modules, users, and applications.
5. **Sustainability:** Establish a sustainable revenue model for the continuous operation and improvement of the DAO.
6. **Upgradeability:** Allow for seamless upgrades to the governance model and AI modules to adapt to changing conditions and needs.
7. **Independence:** Ensure decisions are made by the community, not by centralized bodies or first-class citizens.
8. **Unstoppability:** Automate the enactment of community-approved decisions, making the DAO unstoppable even by its creators.

## User Levels
1. **Founders:** Founders are the initial members of the DAO. They have significant decision-making power over strategic plans and operations, and can freely use, distribute the developed AI modules and build their own business applications on top.
2. **Builder Members:** All DAO token holders are considered Builder Members and have the right to participate in decision-making processes. This includes starting proposals, voting, forming alliances, and delegating votes. Builder Members can freely use the developed AI modules to build their own business applications on top. 

## Decision-Making Process
Our decision-making process is designed to be transparent, efficient, and resistant to manipulation. More to come on this soon.

1. **Proposal Submission:** Proposals are discussed with the community and can be submitted by any DAO token holder. A decision deposit is required to start the proposal.
2. **Decision Period:** The voting starts, and the proposal is now eligible to be approved if it meets the criteria for community approval (positive votes) and support (positive votes compared to the total number of possible votes).
3. **Enactment Period:** If a proposal is accepted, it is enacted after the Enactment period, serving as a failsafe measure.

## Interoperability
We are designed to work seamlessly with other chains or organizations, allowing us to benefit from other governance systems and make joint decisions with other groups.
